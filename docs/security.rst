Security: Verified HTTPS with SSL/TLS
=====================================

Very important fact: **By default, urllib3 does not verify HTTPS requests.**

The historic reason for this is that we rely on ``httplib`` for some of the
HTTP protocol implementation, and ``httplib`` does not verify requests out of
the box. This is not a good reason, but here we are.

Luckily, it's not too hard to enable verified HTTPs requests and there are a
few ways to do it.


Using Certifi with urllib3
--------------------------

`Certifi <http://certifi.io/>`_ is a package which ships with Mozilla's root
certificates for easy programmatic access.

1. Install the Python ``certifi`` package::

    $ pip install certifi

2. Setup your pool to require a certificate and provide the certifi bundle::

    import urllib3
    import certifi

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=certifi.where(),  # Path to the Certifi bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib3.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...

Make sure to update your ``certifi`` package regularly to get the latest root
certificates.


Using your system's root certificates
-------------------------------------

Your system's root certificates will probably be more up-to-date than
maintaining your own, but the trick is finding where they live. Different
operating systems have them in different places.

For example, on most Linux distributions they're at
``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``. On Windows and OS X? `It's not so simple
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10095676/openssl-reasonable-default-for-trusted-ca-certificates>`_.

Once you find your root certificate file::

    import urllib3

    ca_certs = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"  # Or wherever it lives.

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=ca_certs,         # Path to your certificate bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib3.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...


OpenSSL / PyOpenSSL
-------------------

By default, we use the standard library's ``ssl`` module. Unfortunately, it
doesn't support all features like SNI.

If you'd prefer to use the Python OpenSSL bindings instead, you'll need to
install the required packages::

    $ pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1

Once the packages are installed, you can tell urllib3 to switch the ssl backend
to PyOpenSSL with :func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3`::

    import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
    urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()

Now you can continue using urllib3 as you normally would.

For more details, check the :mod:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl` module.
