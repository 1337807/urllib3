Security: Verified HTTPS with SSL/TLS
=====================================

Very important fact: **By default, urllib3 does not verify HTTPS requests.**

The historic reason for this is that we rely on ``httplib`` for some of the
HTTP protocol implementation, and ``httplib`` does not verify requests out of
the box. This is not a good reason, but here we are.

Luckily, it's not too hard to enable verified HTTPS requests and there are a
few ways to do it.


.. _certifi-with-urllib3:

Using Certifi with urllib3
--------------------------

`Certifi <http://certifi.io/>`_ is a package which ships with Mozilla's root
certificates for easy programmatic access.

1. Install the Python ``certifi`` package::

    $ pip install certifi

2. Setup your pool to require a certificate and provide the certifi bundle::

    import urllib3
    import certifi

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=certifi.where(),  # Path to the Certifi bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib3.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...

Make sure to update your ``certifi`` package regularly to get the latest root
certificates.


Using your system's root certificates
-------------------------------------

Your system's root certificates may be more up-to-date than maintaining your
own, but the trick is finding where they live. Different operating systems have
them in different places.

For example, on most Linux distributions they're at
``/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt``. On Windows and OS X? `It's not so simple
<https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10095676/openssl-reasonable-default-for-trusted-ca-certificates>`_.

Once you find your root certificate file::

    import urllib3

    ca_certs = "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"  # Or wherever it lives.

    http = urllib3.PoolManager(
        cert_reqs='CERT_REQUIRED', # Force certificate check.
        ca_certs=ca_certs,         # Path to your certificate bundle.
    )

    # You're ready to make verified HTTPS requests.
    try:
        r = http.request('GET', 'https://example.com/')
    except urllib3.exceptions.SSLError as e:
        # Handle incorrect certificate error.
        ...


OpenSSL / PyOpenSSL
-------------------

By default, we use the standard library's ``ssl`` module. Unfortunately, there
are several limitations which are addressed by PyOpenSSL:

- (Python 2.x) SNI support.
- (Python 2.x-3.2) Disabling compression to mitigate `CRIME attack
  <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME_(security_exploit)>`_.

To use the Python OpenSSL bindings instead, you'll need to install the required
packages::

    $ pip install pyopenssl ndg-httpsclient pyasn1

Once the packages are installed, you can tell urllib3 to switch the ssl backend
to PyOpenSSL with :func:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3`::

    import urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl
    urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl.inject_into_urllib3()

Now you can continue using urllib3 as you normally would.

For more details, check the :mod:`~urllib3.contrib.pyopenssl` module.



InsecureRequestWarning
----------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.9

Unverified HTTPS requests will trigger a warning::

    urllib3/connectionpool.py:736: InsecureRequestWarning: Unverified HTTPS
    request is being made. Adding certificate verification is strongly advised.
    See: https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html
    (This warning will only appear once by default.)

This would be a great time to enable HTTPS verification:
:ref:`certifi-with-urllib3`.

If you know what you're doing and would like to disable this and other warnings,
you can use :func:`~urllib3.disable_warnings`::

    import urllib3
    urllib3.disable_warnings()

Making unverified HTTPS requests is strongly discouraged. ˙ ͜ʟ˙



Google App Engine Requirements
------------------------------

By Default, GAE does not allow you to make http/https connection to other
applications like `api.twitter.com`, so in order to make this library working
properly in your GAE application you have to enable the billing information in
your application setting and include the ssl library in your application yaml
file as well. e.g:

    libraries:
    - name: ssl
       version: latest
