class Retry(object):
    """ Granular retry configuration.

    This object should be treated as immutable. Each retry creates a new Retry
    object with updated values.

    Example usage::

        retries = urllib3.util.Retry(connect=5, read=2,
            codes_whitelist=[429, 500, 503])
        pool = HTTPConnectionPool('www.google.com', 80)
        pool.request(retries=retries)

    :param int total:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.

        Setting total to ``None`` will remove this constraint and fall back on
        other counts. It's a good idea to set this to some sensibly-high value
        to account for unexpected edge cases and avoid infinite retry loops.

    :param int connect:
        How many connection-related errors to retry on.

        These are errors raised before the request is sent to the remote server,
        which we assume has not triggered the server to process the request.

    :param int read:
        How many times to retry on read errors.

        These errors are raised after the request was sent to the server, so the
        request may have side-effects.

        By default, we don't retry on any of these errors.

    :param int redirects:
        How many redirects to perform. Limit this to avoid infinite redirect
        loops.

        A redirect is a HTTP response with a status code 301, 302, 303, 307 or
        308.

    :param iterable method_whitelist:
        Set of HTTP method verbs that we should retry on.

        By default, we only retry on methods which are considered to be
        indempotent (multiple requests with the same parameters end with the
        same state). See :attr:`Retry.DEFAULT_METHOD_WHITELIST`.

    :param iterable codes_whitelist:
        A set of HTTP status codes that we should retry on.

        By default, this is disabled with ``None``.

    :param float backoff_factor:
        A backoff factor to apply between attempts. urllib3 will sleep for::

            {backoff factor} * (2 ^ ({number of total retries} - 1))

        seconds. If the backoff_factor is 0.1, then each retry will sleep for
        [0.1s, 0.2s, 0.4s, ...] between retries. It will never be longer than
        :attr:`Retry.MAX_BACKOFF`.

        By default, backoff is disabled (set to 0).

    :param bool raise_on_redirect: Whether, if the number of redirects is
        exhausted, to raise a MaxRetryError, or to return a response with a
        response code in the 3xx range.

    :param int observed_errors: The number of errors observed so far. This is
        used to compute the backoff time and other factors.
